## Introduction

![intro](https://github.com/AbdulAfeez001/DS_Salary_Analysis/assets/97398702/f84c449b-62ed-407b-b775-bbc8b9e265f5)
 
This is an analysis of the earnings of Data Scientists and other tech job roles across different continents, understanding the favorable patterns which might contribute to the earning variations.

The aim of this project is to show case my analytics and visualization skills using (data scientists’ salary) data with user friendly navigation using power Bi. 
This report consists of three pages:

1.	Earning detail
2.	Job variation
3.	Job by year 

**_Disclaimer:_** _All datasets and reports do not represent any country, company or institutions but just a datasets to demonstrate my capability of Power BI_  

## Problem Statement

1.	Who are the top 5 earners by years?
2.	What’s the most paid job by title?
3.	What’s the least paid job by title?
4.	Who are the top 3 earners by company location?
5.	What are the salaries in USD by Job title?
6.	What’s the salary comparison in USD between Nigeria and United States?
7.	What’s the salary comparison in USD between Nigeria and Ghana?
8.	What’s the remote ratio by company size? 

## Skills/Concept Demonstrated 

The following Power BI features were incorporated – 
- Bookmarking,
- DAX,
- Page navigation, 
- Button, 
- Tooltips, 
- Filters.

## Data Cleaning 

 **Work Year** 
 
_To be able to use the data well, I had to change the work_year column from whole number to text, then to date_

![Year transf](https://github.com/AbdulAfeez001/DS_Salary_Analysis/assets/97398702/c7284bbb-c840-4ea9-bff6-5a3732d2fa17)


**Company Location**  

_The Company Location column would not reflect if used in a map visual as it appears from the file, I categorized the column as country which makes it accessible to reflect in the map visuals._

**Employee Residence**

_The employee_residence column would not reflect if used in a map visual as it appears from the file, I categorized the column as country which makes it accessible to reflect in the map visuals._

**Salary in USD**

_The salary in USD column appears to be a digit, then for easy comprehension from those who will be reading the report (user-friendly), I changed the column format from whole number to currency._

## Data Modelling

No modelling was done. 

The file contains 11 tables.

## Visualizations

The file contains 3 pages which are:
1.	Earning detail
2.	Job variation
3.	Job by year

## Analysis 

**Earning detail**

![Earning detail](https://github.com/AbdulAfeez001/DS_Salary_Analysis/assets/97398702/c1f892c1-281c-40d8-94cc-3bfba781d02e)

**Job Variation** 

![Job variation](https://github.com/AbdulAfeez001/DS_Salary_Analysis/assets/97398702/45f9d7d3-d349-4b71-b7ed-2adcd0a3c7b6)

**Job by Year**

![Job by year](https://github.com/AbdulAfeez001/DS_Salary_Analysis/assets/97398702/31b873d1-0cdf-4b37-8ef9-da9b4096c6b0)


## Conclusions 

- The top 3 earners by years are: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data scientists which they earn average in USD 1,575,574 and 3,569,397, and 3,227,463 respectively with Data Engineer being the highest earner which might be due to the level of skills required for the job role. 

- The average salary of a data scientist in USD in the United State and Nigeria is 461,538,909 and 390,000 respectively which might be due to the market size and industry of both countries. The United States has highest numbers of Unicorn (1205 at least) which is the biggest market in North America while Nigeria has 5 unicorns which is also the largest market in Africa. 

## Recomendations 

- It would be great if we could have the gender data in the file which gives us the idea of the increase pr decrease in the number of tech enthusiasts over the years.

- The company’s major cities highlight would be great if added to the data where you can analyze the company location by their working policy either Full-time, part-time, hybrid and this would give an idea why a company in New York would be 90% remote by outsourcing out of their locations which gives opportunities to people beyond the borders. 

I believe the above points would also motivate the new influx of people into tech due to the flexibility.
