This is an analysis of the earnings of Data Scientists and other tech job roles across different continents, understanding the favorable patterns which might contribute to the earning variations.

The aim of this project is to show case my analytics and visualization skills using (data scientists’ salary) data with user friendly navigation using power Bi. 
This report consists of three pages:

1.	Earning detail
2.	Job variation
3.	Job by year 

**_Disclaimer:_** _All datasets and reports do not represent any country, company or institutions but just a datasets to demonstrate my capability of Power BI_  

## Problem Statement

1.	Who are the top 5 earners by years?
2.	What’s the most paid job by title?
3.	What’s the least paid job by title?
4.	Who are the top 3 earners by company location?
5.	What are the salaries in USD by Job title?
6.	What’s the salary comparison in USD between Nigeria and United States?
7.	What’s the salary comparison in USD between Nigeria and Ghana?
8.	What’s the remote ratio by company size?

## Conclusions 

- The top 3 earners by years are: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data scientists which they earn average in USD 1,575,574 and 3,569,397, and 3,227,463 respectively with Data Engineer being the highest earner which might be due to the level of skills required for the job role. 

- The average salary of a data scientist in USD in the United State and Nigeria is 461,538,909 and 390,000 respectively which might be due to the market size and industry of both countries. The United States has highest numbers of Unicorn (1205 at least) which is the biggest market in North America while Nigeria has 5 unicorns which is also the largest market in Africa.
